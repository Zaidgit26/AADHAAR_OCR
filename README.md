# Aadhaar OCR & Verification API

A high-performance, secure API for extracting and validating information from Aadhaar documents, featuring multi-language OCR support, end-to-end encryption, and comprehensive data extraction capabilities. Built with FastAPI and Tesseract OCR, this solution ensures accurate processing while maintaining strict security standards for sensitive data.

## Key Features

### Secure Document Processing
- End-to-end encryption for data transmission
- Secure handling of password-protected PDFs
- Transient data processing with no permanent storage
- Robust input validation and sanitization

### Advanced OCR Capabilities
- Multi-language support (English and Tamil)
- Sophisticated image preprocessing pipeline
- High-accuracy text extraction using Tesseract OCR
- Confidence scoring for extracted data

### Comprehensive Data Extraction
- Complete Aadhaar detail extraction including:
  - Name (with bilingual support)
  - Guardian Name
  - Date of Birth
  - Gender
  - Aadhaar Number
  - Complete Address
  - Contact Information

## Technical Stack

- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI for high-performance async operations
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract with custom preprocessing
- **PDF Processing**: PyPDF2 for secure document handling
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV for advanced preprocessing
- **Security**: Built-in rate limiting and encryption

## Production Features

- Async request handling for optimal performance
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Detailed logging and error reporting
- Rate limiting for API protection

## Security Measures

- HTTPS enforcement for data transmission
- Secure password-protected PDF handling
- No permanent storage of sensitive data
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting against abuse

## Future Roadmap
